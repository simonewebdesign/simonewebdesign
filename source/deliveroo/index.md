## I'm a full-stack web developer.<br>I love to make things — I love the web, design, code and good food — mostly eating it.


<br>


### Let's talk about you

You are Deliveroo. You're hiring talented people exclusively. You want to show the world that you're the best. You need the best people that will bring you far more customers than you have today.

#### An amazing product

You already have an awesome product, but awesome is still not enough. You want it to be *a-ma-zing*. For that, you need someone with great skills and passion, someone who really loves tough challenges.

You've been backed by the best investors already, you need to keep running. You want someone who has the courage to fight for an idea, the will to innovate. Someone that's not afraid to show he's right.

#### A global brand

You're expanding globally — we all know what that means: big challenges to face, tough competition and cultural barriers to avoid, just to name a few. This all means you got to be stronger than ever. That's why you're building a great team — you want to be the very best!

### Let's talk about me

I'm a twenty-six-year-old Italian web developer and I moved in London three years ago. I must say, these have been without any doubt the greatest years of my entire life. I worked for amazing startups and met a lot of exceptional people with incredible skills. I want to keep learning and doing things, because this is what makes me passionate about my job.

##### Things I love

I have *a lot* of interests, really. Thing is, there's so much to be interested in that it's literally *impossible* to get bored. There is so much to be interested in, to learn about, and to pour one’s creativity into. I spend time learning new programming languages and design patterns, or writing new tools, apps or videogames. There are a million things I want to try, to do, to be better at. There is never enough time in the day, week, or year for everything; though I’m really trying.

#### What I do

I work for a pretty cool company in London called MyMeds&Me. We use some rad technologies such as **Elixir** and **Elm**. We have an amazing team of developers, we use and admire functional programming, and we try our best to make customers happy. I'm a frontend developer here, which means I'm the one in charge of making our web products reliable, beautiful and fun to use.

##### Why Deliveroo?

I'll be honest: MyMeds&Me is a great place to work. I have creative freedom, a good work environment, talented co-workers and I'm handsomely compensated. Really, I cannot think of anything that would keep me from being here a very long time, except that I want more. Not necessarily stuff or money, but I want to learn more and get better. I want to keep the pressure up. I want to take on the toughest challenges.

I didn’t make this page lightly; I have spent some time considering whether or not to really go for this. <b>I love a challenge.</b> I love the idea of working with people that are brilliant; whom I admire and respect. I know what it means to work together to make something great. And I look forward to making Deliveroo better by my addition. I want to learn from you and I want to teach you and I want to learn things together.

<blockquote>I had the pleasure of having pair programming sessions with Simone, in which I could appreciate his pragmatic approach to problems and his great enthusiasm and productivity. I was impressed by his extensive knowledge of web development. I've also appreciated his friendly and genuine personality.

### Portfolio

Here's a selection of websites I designed that I’m pretty proud of. For most of them I created it from start to finish including client consultation, design, HTML/CSS/JS, backend development and copywriting.
