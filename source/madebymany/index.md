## I'm a developer.<br>I love to make things — I love the web, code and a hard challenge.<br>I think we should talk.


<br>

<!-- https://madebymany.com/blog/we-re-hiring-a-back-end-developer-in-london -->

<!-- We’re looking for a back-end developer to work primarily on Ruby on Rails and Elixir Phoenix apps who also has experience in AWS and a keen interest in devops using tools like Docker and Terraform. -->


### Let's talk about you

You are **Made by Many**. You're hiring talented people exclusively. You want to show the world that you're the best. You need the best people that will bring you far more customers than you have today.

#### A great team

At **Made by Many** it's the [people who matter the most](https://madebymany.com/jobs), and that's why you attracted some great minds in your team. **Made by Many** is what happens when a bunch of **wildly talented people** get together.

#### Amazing projects

You've done some [really impressive work](https://madebymany.com/work), built with the right technologies for the job. You want to keep producing innovative solutions, and build a company culture where people love what they do.

### Let's talk about me

I've been called “restless”. I mean, I sleep at night, but thing is, there's so much to be interested in that it's literally *impossible* to get bored. So much to learn about, such as new programming languages and design patterns, and so much to pour one’s creativity into, like apps, tools, video games. There are a million things I want to try, to do, to be better at. There is never enough time in the day, week, or year for everything; though I’m really trying.

#### What I do

I work for a pretty cool company in London called My Meds & Me. We use rad technologies too, such as **Elixir**, **Phoenix**, **Docker** and **Kubernetes**. We have an amazing team of developers, we use and admire functional programming, and we try our best to make customers happy. I'm a full-stack developer here, which means I find myself always doing a bit of everything, ranging from back end to front end, even devops. Ultimately I'm in charge of making our web product reliable, beautiful and fun to use.

I'll be honest: My Meds & Me is a great place to work. I have creative freedom, a good work environment, talented co-workers and I'm handsomely compensated. Really, I cannot think of anything that would keep me from being here a very long time, except that I want more. Not necessarily stuff or money, but I want to learn more and get better. I want to keep the pressure up. I want to take on the toughest challenges.

I didn’t make this page lightly; I have spent some time considering whether or not to really go for this. <b>I love a challenge.</b> I love the idea of working with people that are brilliant; whom I admire and respect. I know what it means to work together to make something great. And I look forward to making **Made by Many** better by my addition. I want to learn from you and I want to teach you and I want to learn things together.

After all, [you do like challenges](https://madebymany.com/about) too, don't you?

<blockquote>I had the pleasure of having pair programming sessions with Simone, in which I could appreciate his pragmatic approach to problems and his great enthusiasm and productivity. I was impressed by his extensive knowledge of web development. I've also appreciated his friendly and genuine personality.
