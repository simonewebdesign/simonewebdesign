Simone Vittori is a web developer originally from [Perugia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perugia), Italy, but now living in London, England. He strongly believes in Open Source, and thinks that [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) is the best programming language ever made. He is truly passionate about his job: if he is not coding, he is probably reading, writing or speaking about it. Last but not least, he’s obsessed with bits, pixels, zombies, dinosaurs, and gems.

## simonewebdesign.it

This is my personal web site in which I blog about web programming since 2010. I changed its face a bunch of times: initially it was a portfolio site running in Flash (!), then a one page HTML5 static site, and finally a WordPress blog, until I decided to switch to [OctoPress]({% post_url 2014-05-13-bye-bye-wordpress-welcome-octopress %}). I made this change because I believe that websites have to be fast and simple. Indeed, this site has:

- <strong>No backend.</strong> there is no database. All pages are actually just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br>This results in a super fast website.

- <strong>No ads.</strong> I blog about web programming so that I don't forget important stuff I learn during my journey as a developer, and because I love to share my work. I don't care about anything else.

- <strong>Open source.</strong> All the source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/simonewebdesign), so yes, you can read it, copy it, use it... whatever. Feel free to do anything you want, as long as you enjoy it.

## Contact

Even though I happily work full time as full-stack web developer, I’m always keen on participating in new exciting projects.
