    Simone Vittori is a web developer originally from <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perugia">Perugia</a>, Italy, but now living in London, England. He strongly believes in open source, and thinks that <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> is the best programming language ever made. He is truly passionate about his job: if he is not coding, he is probably reading, writing or speaking about it. Last but not least, heâ€™s obsessed with bits, pixels, zombies, dinosaurs, and gems.

<blockquote>

<p>I believe programming is an art. We're all artists while we craft code, and we're all constantly in search of perfection.</p>

<p>My style of coding is calm, mindful and thoughtful. I love to contemplate my code, and I enjoy reading other programmers' code.</p>

<p>I read a lot, because I'm always willing to learn. The more you read, the more you learn. And it makes me happy.</p>

## simonewebdesign.it

This is my personal website in which I blog about web programming since 2010. In case you're interested, here are some facts about it:

- **There is no backend nor database.**
All pages are actually just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and this results in a super fast website. I believe all software have to be fast and simple. Websites are no exception.

- **No advertising.**
I blog about web programming so that I don't forget important stuff I learn during my journey as a developer, and because I enjoy sharing my work with others.

- **Open source.**
All the source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/simonewebdesign), so yes, you can read it, copy it, sell it... the usual stuff. Feel free to do anything you want, as long as you enjoy it.
