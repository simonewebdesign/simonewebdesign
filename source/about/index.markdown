    Simone Vittori is a software developer originally from <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perugia">Perugia</a>, Italy, but now living in London, England. He's obsessed about code: if he's not writing it, he's probably reading, speaking or dreaming about it. He enjoys coding in many different programming languages, such as Elixir, Erlang, Elm, Ruby, Haskell and JavaScriptâ€”not all at the same time though.

<blockquote>

<p>I believe programming is art. We're all artists while we craft code, constantly in search of perfection.</p>

<p>My coding style is calm and thoughtful. I love to contemplate my code, and I enjoy reading other programmers' code.</p>

<p>I read a lot. The more you read, the more you learn. And it makes me happy.</p>

## simonewebdesign.it

This is my personal website in which I blog about programming since 2010. Here are some facts:

- **There is no backend nor database.** All pages are actually just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which results in a super fast website that can't be hacked.

- **No advertising.**
I blog about programming so that I don't forget important stuff and because I enjoy sharing my work with others.

- **Made with Octopress**, a static site generator based on Jekyll. I'll probably switch to Jekyll someday, unless something better comes up.

- **Open source.**
All the source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/simonewebdesign), so yes, you can do anything you want with it.
