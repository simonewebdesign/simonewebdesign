Simone Vittori is a web developer originally from Perugia, Italy, but now living in London, England. He strongly believes in Open Source, and thinks that Ruby is the best programming language ever made. He is truly passionate about his job: if he is not coding, he is probably reading, writing or speaking about it. Last but not least, he’s obsessed with bits, pixels, zombies, dinosaurs, and gems.

## SIMONEWEBDESIGN.IT

Simonewebdesign.it is my personal web site in which I blog about web programming since 2010. I changed its face a bunch of times: initially it was a portfolio site running in Flash (!), then a one page HTML5 static site, and finally a WordPress blog, until I decided to switch to OctoPress.

That's why it's so fast: because all pages are actually static HTML/CSS pages (with some JavaScript as well, of course), and it's hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

Last but not least, it's open source. All the source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/simonewebdesign), so yes, you can read it, copy it, fork it... whatever. Feel free to do anything you want, as long as you enjoy it.

This site has no advertising at all. I blog about web programming so that I can't forget important stuff I learn during my journey as a developer, and because I love to share my work.

## Contact

Even though I happily work full time as full-stack web developer, I’m always keen on participating in new exciting side projects.
