<strong>Simone Vittori</strong> is a programmer originally from <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perugia">Perugia</a>, Italy, but now living in London, England. He's obsessed about code: if he's not writing it, he's probably reading, speaking or dreaming about it. He enjoys coding in many different languages, such as <a rel="external" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://gleam.run/">Gleam</a>, just to name a few. In his free time, he loves walking in nature, eating pasta and playing video games.</p>

## {{ site.domain }}

I founded this site in 2010, back when Adobe Flash and Internet Explorer 6 were still a thing. It went through a few iterations since then, going from a humble personal space to a WordPress blog, until I settled with [Octopress]({% post_url 2014-05-13-bye-bye-wordpress-welcome-octopress %}), a static site generator based on <a rel="external" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.

Fun facts:

- **It is free and open source.** It's my way of giving back to the <a rel="external" href="https://indieweb.org/">indie web</a>. It feels good <a rel="external" href="https://github.com/simonewebdesign/simonewebdesign">to share</a>, and it's <a rel="external" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fs-and-sustainable-development.html">the right thing.</a>

- **There is no backend nor database.** All pages are actually [just HTML & CSS]({% post_url 2022-10-09-one-request %}), resulting in a super fast website that can't be hacked.

- **No advertising or tracking either.**
I write blog posts so that I don't forget stuff I learn and because I enjoy sharing my work.
