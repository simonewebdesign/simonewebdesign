<p>
Simone Vittori is a software developer originally from <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perugia">Perugia</a>, Italy, but now living in London, England. He's obsessed about code: if he's not writing it, he's probably reading, speaking or dreaming about it. He enjoys coding in many different programming languages, such as <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>, <a rel="external nofollow" href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.

## simonewebdesign.it

This is my personal website, founded in 2010. Become a blog in 2012. Some facts:

- **Made with Octopress**, a static site generator based on <a rel="external nofollow" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.

- **There is no backend nor database.** All pages are actually just HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which results in a super fast website that can't be hacked.

- **No advertising either.**
I write blog posts so that I don't forget important stuff and because I enjoy sharing my work with others.


<blockquote>
<p>I believe programming is art. We're all artists while we craft code, constantly in search of perfection.</p>

<p>My coding style is calm and thoughtful. I love to contemplate my code, and I enjoy reading other programmers' code.</p>

<p>I read a lot. The more you read, the more you learn. And it makes me happy.</p>
