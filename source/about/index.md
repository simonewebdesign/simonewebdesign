<h2>simonewebdesign.it</h2>

This is my personal website, founded in 2010. Became also a blog in 2012.

<!--It went through a bit of a journey since then: it started as a humble personal space, made in Adobe Flash(!). A couple of years later I decided to make it a Wordpress blog, only to migrate it to Octopress in 2014. Eventually I settled with Jekyll, though who knows what the next iteration will bring?-->

Fun facts:

- **It's been made with <a rel="external" href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>**, a static site generator based on <a rel="external" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.

- **There is no backend nor database.** All pages are actually just HTML & CSS, resulting in a super fast website that can't be hacked.

- **No advertising either.**
I write blog posts so that I don't forget stuff I learn and because I enjoy sharing my work with others.
