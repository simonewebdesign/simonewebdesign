<strong>Simone Vittori</strong> is a software engineer originally from <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perugia">Perugia</a>, Italy, but now living in London, England. He's obsessed about code: if he's not writing it, he's probably reading, speaking or dreaming about it. He enjoys coding in many different programming languages, such as <a rel="external" href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, <a rel="external" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, just to name a few.</p>

## simonewebdesign.it

This is my personal website, founded in 2010. Became also a blog in 2012.

Some facts:

- **It's made with <a rel="external" href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>**, a static site generator based on <a rel="external" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.

- **There is no backend nor database.** All pages are actually just HTML & CSS, resulting in a super fast website that can't be hacked.

- **No advertising either.**
I write blog posts so that I don't forget stuff I learn and because I enjoy sharing my work with others.
