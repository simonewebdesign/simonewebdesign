<p>Here's a list of sites I made throughout my career.</p>


<div id="blog-archives">
{% for entry in site.data.sites %}
{% capture this_year %}{{ entry.year }}{% endcapture %}
{% unless year == this_year %}
  {% assign year = this_year %}
  <h2>{{ entry.year }}</h2>
{% endunless %}
<article>
  <h1><a rel="external nofollow" href="//{{ entry.url }}">{{ entry.title }}</a></h1>
</article>
{% endfor %}
</div>
