It's been three weeks since I ported my site, *simonewebdesign.it*, from Fly.io to Cloudflare. I'm writing this blog post to rationalize the choice.

If you're considering switching as well, bear in mind that your use case may be completely different from mine. Besides, what I'm about to write is mostly just my personal experience.

## [Why?](#why)

I've been in-between jobs and therefore had a lot more free time than usual, so I thought I would give this site a bit of love. There was some long-standing technical debt that I felt like I needed to address.

What you see is a simple static website, generated by Jekyll. The whole thing is on [GitHub](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/simonewebdesign/), in case you're curious to see it, but realistically there's nothing unusual about it; from that perspective, it's just *someone's jekyll site*. Nothing to see here.

So what were the problems?

Fly.io gives you a lot of freedom: you just need to provide a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/dockerfile/), and whatever you put in there will form part of your application.

Now, whilst I appreciate that level of freedom, I think it comes with a tradeoffâ€”when it comes to static web hosting, you only really care about a few things (or **requirements**, if you prefer):

- The site loads **successfully**;
- It is **fast enough**;
- It doesn't take you a lot of **time or money** to deploy.

A bit of history: before Fly.io, I used to host this site on Heroku. It was a modern choice, deploying was as simple as `git push heroku master`, and, perhaps most importantly, it was *free*.

So why did I switch to Fly.io? [I wrote about this before]({% post_url 2022-10-09-one-request %}), but essentially they had so much abuse of their free tier that they had to shut it down. For me, and many others, that meant having to start to pay for their services. When I looked around for an alternative, Fly.io seemed like a great equivalent choice.
