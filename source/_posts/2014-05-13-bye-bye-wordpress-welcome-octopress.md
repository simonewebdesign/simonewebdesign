**I did it!** I've finally migrated my blog to Octopress. It was a bit of a PITA, and it took a lot more than what I expected, but I did it.

Apologies if you weren't able to see the website yesterday; the DNS took about 11 hours to propagate, and the site was back UP just this morning. It is now hosted by Heroku and it's **faster than ever**.

Prepare yourself to see lots of new stuff in the next few weeks! ;-)
