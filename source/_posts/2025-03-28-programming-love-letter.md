<!-- I tried writing this post before, but felt it was a bit too corny. Regardless, I decided to revamp it and share it anyway. Some of you may find it inspiring, perhaps. -->

Think a little about why you enjoy what you enjoy.

Why do you code? What do you like about it? I've been asking myself these questions, but I haven't quite found the answer yet. Maybe there's no single answer, after all. For me, it's an _ensemble_; there's a whole range of reasons that make programming so enticing to me. For example, I feel like...<!--more-->

- **Programming is like writing a poem.** A beautiful set of words that fit well together; ideally short &amp; sweet. Finding the right balance is tricky, but very rewarding once you do.

- **Programming is like solving a puzzle.** Each piece has its own place, and the satisfaction of fitting them all together can be immensely gratifying. The most experienced developers realise there's often a plethora of solutions to the same problem, and finding that perfect fit can be just as rewarding as solving a tricky challenge.

- **Programming is like painting.** Paul Graham wrote [a whole essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) about it. _Hackers and Painters_ have so much in common, indeed. They're both **makers**; they want to make their masterpiece, and every little detail matters just as much as the big picture.

- **Programming is like an indoor plant**. You nurture it, cut here and there from time to time. Refactoring code is a bit like caring for a bonsai tree: the branches you cut might grow back stronger.

- **Programming is like building an airplane**. It has to be lean and fast, so the less it carries, the better. Less is more; you know it's ready to fly when you removed as much as you could, and there's nothing else to add.

- **Programming is a fun activity.** I love spending hours every day thinking about solutions to problems—sometimes my own, sometimes other people's—I just find it fun and exciting. Being able to **create** something from a blank slate, is what inspires me the most.

Ultimately, coding is much more than a technical skill; it's a way of thinking that can permeate through every aspect of your life.

What inspires you to code?
