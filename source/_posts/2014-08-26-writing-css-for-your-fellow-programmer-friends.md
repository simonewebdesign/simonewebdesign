Writing CSS has always been hard. Especially nowadays, where a site has to be the same across thousands of different devices, i.e., responsive design.

Maybe even worse, some people tend to underestimate the problems that come with responsive design. Maybe it's me, but seems that some people (especially the ones that ) don't even realize that CSS is a turing complete programming language.
