  <img src="/images/laravel4.webp" alt="Laravel logo" class="basic-alignment left" /> <em><strong>Laaadies and gentlemen!</strong></em> I&#8217;m proud to announce that <a href="https://laravel.com" title="Laravel official website" rel="external">Laravel 4</a> has been released today!
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;m really excited about this release because it&#8217;s the result of an intensive year of hard work. I truly believe it is <strong>the best <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (recursive acronym)">PHP</abbr> framework</strong> out there. The Laravel Team worked hard to bring out the new Laravel4&#8242;s cool features, and I&#8217;m sure it will prove to be worth of work!
</p>

<p>
  If you haven&#8217;t checked out Laravel yet, please please <strong>please do it now</strong>! It&#8217;s just an incredible framework. I love it because it&#8217;s so simple, intuitive, and beautiful I can&#8217;t even believe it is developed in <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (recursive acronym)">PHP</abbr>. If you are a professional <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (recursive acronym)">PHP</abbr> developer, you just can&#8217;t know Laravel. Give it a try: you&#8217;ll never go back. Guaranteed.
