This script will install **the latest build of Sublime Text 3**, released on **29 August 2014** (build 3065).

Just run this in your shell:

``` bash
curl -L git.io/sublimetext | sh
```

Should work on most Linux distros; if not, please let me know!

The script is <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonewebdesign/8507139" title="View it on GitHub">open source</a> and will install the <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/" rel="nofollow">Package Control</a> as well.

Enjoy!
