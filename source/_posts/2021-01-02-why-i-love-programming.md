Why do you program? What do you like about it? I've been asking myself these questions, but I haven't really found the answer yet. Maybe there's no single answer, after all. It's an _ensemble_, a whole range of reasons that make programming so enticing to me. For example...

**Programming is like writing a poem.** A beautiful set of words that fit well together; ideally short &amp; sweet. Finding the right balance is tricky, but very rewarding once you do.

**Programming is like solving a puzzle.** Sometimes it does feel like looking for that missing piece. Often you think it's the right one, but it doesn't quite fit. It _must_ be somewhere though—just keep searching.

**Programming is like painting.** [Paul Graham wrote a whole essay about it](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html) (do check it out if you haven't). Hackers and painters have _so much_ in common, indeed. We're both **makers**; we want to make a _masterpiece_.

**Programming is like an indoor plant**. You nurture it, cut here and there from time to time. Refactoring code is a bit like caring for a bonsai tree: the branches you cut will grow back stronger.

**Programming is like building an airplane**. It has to be lean and fast, and the less it carries, the better. Less is more; you know it's ready to fly when you removed as much as you could, and there's nothing else to add.

**Programming is a fun activity.** Well, not all the time, but at least some of it. I love spending hours thinking about solutions to problems — sometimes my own, sometimes other people's — I find it exciting. Being able to **create** something from a blank slate, is what inspires me.

What inspires you?
