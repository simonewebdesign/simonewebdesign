# Reducer vs transducer: what's the difference?

You might have heard of those terms, but never really understood what they actually mean.

Let's start from the basics.

## What is reduce?

Reduce, also known as `foldl` (fold from the left), accumulate, inject, etc... is a function that takes two parameters. The first one can be any data structure (i.e. a number, an array, an object... anything really). The second one is another function that also takes two parameters. This second function is called a *reducer*.

So, in terms of pseudo code:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]

const reduce = numbers, (a, b) => { ... }
```

Now, let's talk about this `(a, b) => { ... }` part. This is the reducer.
