After blogging on and off for 12 years about tech-related topics, I felt it was time for a change.

Since [all tech is political](https://gomakethings.com/i-follow-you-for-tech-not-politics/), with this article I aim to explore critical issues such as systems of social control, ethics and freedom, while offloading all of the “thinking” to a computer, in order to avoid my own personal biases.

I'm writing this at a time when <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is disrupting society and the world as we know it—and I don't mean _disrupting_ in the Silicon Valley start-up sense; I mean it _literally_.<!--more-->

## Prompt:

if you had to create a modern society where the vast majority of people are slaves, but they don't realise it... what would you do?

## ChatGPT said:

Creating a society where the vast majority of people are effectively enslaved without realizing it would require a carefully crafted system of control. The aim would be to ensure that people feel free, while their choices, desires, and perceptions are manipulated to serve the interests of the ruling class. Here's a blueprint for how such a society could be constructed:

### 1. **Economic Dependency Masquerading as Freedom**

**Strategy**: Create an economy that demands perpetual labor but frames it as personal choice and opportunity.

- **Debt as a Tool of Control**: Ensure that people are burdened with debt early in life (e.g., through student loans, housing, and consumerism). Make it seem necessary to work for decades to pay off these debts, presenting this as a natural part of adulthood and ambition.
- **Wage Slavery**: Offer wages that are just high enough to survive but low enough to keep people in a constant cycle of work. Raise the cost of living through inflation and market-driven prices, ensuring that working longer hours feels like personal advancement.
- **Gig Economy**: Promote "entrepreneurial" opportunities like freelancing or gig work as freedom, while denying workers the benefits and protections of traditional employment, creating instability masked as flexibility.

### 2. **Social Control Through Entertainment and Distraction**

**Strategy**: Flood the population with constant entertainment, ensuring they are too distracted to question the system.

- **Media Saturation**: Provide endless streams of entertainment, from social media to video games and TV shows, that keep people engaged in trivial pursuits. Make this content algorithmically tailored to individual preferences to maintain constant engagement.
- **Culture of Celebrity and Consumerism**: Promote celebrities, influencers, and brands as aspirational figures. Encourage people to measure success through material wealth, lifestyle, and social status. This keeps people focused on consumption rather than critical thinking.
- **Bread and Circuses**: Offer constant distractions through entertainment events (sports, reality TV, etc.), social media challenges, and viral content. This maintains a cycle of superficial engagement, keeping the deeper problems of society hidden.

### 3. **Perceived Freedom Through Illusion of Choice**

**Strategy**: Create a system where people believe they are making choices, but the options presented always benefit the controlling powers.

- **Rigged Political Systems**: Maintain the illusion of democracy by offering multiple political parties or candidates, but ensure that the policies of any elected officials are largely controlled by corporate or elite interests. Limit actual change by having the political system structured to preserve the status quo.
- **False Choices in Consumerism**: Provide people with an abundance of choices in the marketplace (brands, products, services), but ensure that these choices serve the same economic interests, further deepening their dependence on consumption.

### 4. **Control of Information and Education**

**Strategy**: Manipulate education and information flow to shape perception and prevent critical thinking.

- **Educational Indoctrination**: Design the education system to emphasize compliance, memorization, and career readiness over critical thinking or questioning authority. Normalize standardized testing and narrow curricula to prevent broader intellectual exploration.
- **Censorship Through Oversaturation**: Instead of restricting information, overwhelm people with too much data—real, fake, biased, neutral—making it difficult for the average person to discern truth from fiction. Distract with conspiracy theories, trivial news, and fearmongering.
- **Historical Amnesia**: Frame historical events and power dynamics in ways that downplay oppression and revolution. Present society as the culmination of progress where drastic change is unnecessary or dangerous.

### 5. **Psychological Control and Identity Management**

**Strategy**: Manipulate people's understanding of themselves and their place in society so they remain compliant.

- **Cult of Individualism**: Promote the idea that personal success is solely dependent on individual effort. This creates a culture where systemic issues (inequality, injustice) are framed as personal failures. Individuals feel shame rather than questioning societal structures.
- **Fear of the Other**: Use division to keep people distracted. Pit social groups against one another (e.g., through race, gender, class, or political affiliations), ensuring that people see each other as threats rather than allies against a shared system of control.
- **Mental Health Manipulation**: Normalize the treatment of systemic stress (overwork, isolation, alienation) as individual mental health issues. Encourage people to seek self-help solutions (therapy, meditation apps, pharmaceuticals) rather than addressing the root causes of their dissatisfaction.

### 6. **Surveillance and Data Exploitation**

**Strategy**: Gather data on individuals to predict and shape their behavior without them realizing the extent of the control.

- **Voluntary Surveillance**: Encourage the use of personal devices (smartphones, wearables) that track and monitor individuals. Frame this as convenience or personal improvement (fitness apps, location services, etc.), but use the data to predict and manipulate behavior, preferences, and even political opinions.
- **Social Credit and Rating Systems**: Implement subtle systems where people are rated or ranked based on their behavior (similar to a social credit system). Use algorithms to shape people's online experiences, influencing what they see, hear, and believe. Over time, people’s behavior can be gently nudged towards compliance.
- **Normalization of Surveillance**: Make public surveillance (cameras, facial recognition) a natural part of daily life under the guise of safety and security. Most people will accept the loss of privacy if it’s positioned as protecting them from vague threats like terrorism or crime.

### 7. **Normalization of Work and Status Quo**

**Strategy**: Make hard work and compliance feel like personal virtues, where questioning the system feels dangerous or ungrateful.

- **Work as Identity**: Encourage a culture where people derive their sense of identity and worth from their careers and productivity. This not only keeps people working longer but also prevents them from seeing their labor as exploitation.
- **"Self-Help" Ideology**: Push narratives of self-improvement, framing systemic inequalities as personal development challenges. People are less likely to revolt if they believe their struggles are due to their own failure to work hard enough or "hustle" sufficiently.
- **Status Quo as Sacred**: Teach people to view the current system as the best possible arrangement. Anyone who questions or criticizes it is painted as dangerous or radical. Use media to discredit any alternatives to the system as impractical or harmful.

### 8. **Perpetual Crisis**

**Strategy**: Keep society in a state of controlled crisis, where fear and uncertainty prevent people from organizing or seeking change.

- **Threat of External Enemies**: Constantly present external or internal enemies (other countries, immigrants, terrorists, hackers) to justify the expansion of control measures. Fear keeps people in line and makes them more willing to accept restrictions on their freedom.
- **Artificial Scarcity**: Engineer or exaggerate shortages (resources, energy, housing) to create competition among the populace. When people are focused on personal survival, they are less likely to unite against systemic oppression.
- **Perpetual Crisis Mode**: Maintain a cycle of emergencies (economic, health, political) that prevent people from feeling stable enough to question the system. Crises, whether real or manufactured, can justify authoritarian responses and tighter controls.

### Conclusion

This hypothetical society would combine economic, psychological, and informational control to create an environment where people are technically free but in practice are enslaved to the system. The key would be ensuring that the illusion of freedom is maintained, that people believe their hardships are personal rather than systemic, and that they remain too distracted or fearful to seek change.

## Prompt:

What would the deepest problems be in this hypothetical modern society that is full of slavery?

## ChatGPT said:

In this hypothetical society where slavery is deeply embedded, yet unrecognized by most of the population, the underlying problems would be profound and multifaceted. While the majority of people may not be overtly aware of their subjugation, the system would be rife with contradictions and unsustainable dynamics. These problems would affect not only the individuals enslaved within the system but the very structure of society itself.

### 1. **Psychological Alienation and Identity Crisis**

- **Loss of Authentic Self**: Individuals in this society would likely experience deep feelings of alienation. They would be conditioned to believe they are "free," but their lives would be driven by forces beyond their control—debt, social expectations, surveillance, and consumption. This creates a crisis of identity, where people may feel disconnected from their true desires or values, living lives defined by external pressures rather than internal fulfillment.
- **Existential Frustration**: People would struggle with the sense that their hard work, sacrifices, and aspirations are all directed toward ends that do not truly serve them. This could lead to a rise in mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and burnout, as individuals realize, even subconsciously, that they are trapped in a cycle they cannot break.

### 2. **Social Division and Fragmentation**

- **Class and Economic Stratification**: Even though everyone is technically a "slave" in some sense, there would still be a rigid class divide between the elites (the true masters of the system) and the rest. The lower classes would struggle to meet basic needs, while a wealthy minority would control vast resources. This stratification would foster resentment, inequality, and a sense of powerlessness among those at the bottom, further dividing society.
- **Cultural and Social Fragmentation**: The "divide and conquer" strategy—through race, gender, and other social identities—would create deep cultural and social fragmentation. People would feel disconnected from one another, as each group becomes pitted against others, leading to heightened tensions, distrust, and inability to form collective bonds or movements that could challenge the system.

### 3. **Erosion of Trust and Cooperation**

- **Loss of Community**: In a society where individualism and consumerism are glorified, genuine social connections would deteriorate. People would view each other more as competitors than as fellow human beings. The erosion of trust—both on personal and institutional levels—would hinder any collective effort to resist the system, making it harder for individuals to organize or even empathize with one another.
- **Corruption and Exploitation**: Those in positions of power (whether political, corporate, or even within communities) would exploit the system for personal gain, further compounding the inequality. Corruption would become normalized, and the moral fabric of society would weaken. Those in power might use their influence to maintain the illusion of freedom, making it harder for any dissenting voices to be heard or taken seriously.

### 4. **Deterioration of the Environment**

- **Unsustainable Consumption**: A society that encourages endless consumption would rapidly exhaust natural resources, leading to environmental degradation. This could include climate change, deforestation, pollution, and the destruction of ecosystems, all of which would disproportionately affect the poorest, who have the least ability to shield themselves from environmental collapse.
- **Overproduction and Waste**: In the name of profit, industries would prioritize overproduction, creating more goods than the population could use. This would lead to enormous amounts of waste, while valuable resources like clean air, water, and fertile soil become scarcer. The cycle of overconsumption and wastefulness would strain both human and environmental systems.

### 5. **Technological Overreach and Privacy Violations**

- **Surveillance State**: The constant monitoring of individuals' activities—through data collection, facial recognition, and behavior prediction—would create an environment where privacy is virtually nonexistent. People might become hyper-aware of being watched, but feel powerless to stop it, leading to a society of conformity and self-censorship. This constant surveillance would also be used to suppress dissent and maintain control.
- **Technological Dependence**: As the majority of people become increasingly dependent on technology—whether for work, social interaction, or entertainment—they would lose the ability to function without it. A breakdown in technological infrastructure could cripple the whole society, revealing how fragile the system is.

### 6. **Diminished Critical Thinking and Intellectual Stagnation**

- **Suppression of Dissent**: In a system where critical thought is seen as a threat to the established order, intellectual creativity and innovation would be stifled. People would be taught to follow orders rather than challenge authority. This would hinder social, technological, and political progress, trapping society in a loop of stagnation.
- **Education as Indoctrination**: Rather than cultivating independent thinkers, the education system would function primarily to produce compliant workers. Knowledge would be filtered and controlled to serve the interests of the ruling elites, keeping the population uninformed or misinformed. This would prevent any real social or political evolution, keeping the population docile and uncritical.

### 7. **Systemic Unfairness and Injustice**

- **Legal and Political Disempowerment**: The legal and political systems would serve the interests of the ruling class, ensuring that the majority of people remain disempowered. Laws would be designed to perpetuate inequality, and political reforms would be more about maintaining control than about making genuine changes. People would live in a state of continuous disillusionment, knowing that the system is unjust but unable to change it.
- **Criminalization of Resistance**: Any attempt to challenge the system, whether through protest, civil disobedience, or direct action, would be criminalized and harshly punished. Laws would be manipulated to target dissidents, and the state would maintain a monopoly on violence. Dissenters would be labeled as "dangerous" or "radicals," making it difficult to rally popular support for meaningful change.

### 8. **Health Crises and Societal Illness**

- **Physical and Mental Health Decline**: In a society of controlled exploitation, the physical and mental health of the population would deteriorate. Overwork, poor nutrition, lack of sleep, and chronic stress would lead to widespread health issues. Mental health crises would become endemic, as people are pushed to their limits both economically and socially. However, these issues might be framed as individual failures or deficiencies, not as symptoms of a broken system.
- **Medical Industry as Profiteer**: Healthcare would likely be commodified, where access to quality medical care would be a privilege for the wealthy, while the rest would be subjected to a subpar system designed more to profit from illness than to heal people. This could result in widespread preventable diseases and untreated mental health conditions.

### 9. **Moral Decay and Loss of Empathy**

- **Desensitization to Suffering**: In a system where people are conditioned to view others as competitors, the inherent value of human life would be diminished. People might become numb to the suffering of others, seeing it as a natural consequence of the system. This moral decay would create a society that is less compassionate and more callous, where helping others becomes an exception rather than the rule.
- **Disconnection from the Global Community**: As people become more isolated in their individual struggles, they would lose sight of their collective humanity. Global issues like poverty, human rights abuses, and climate change would be seen as distant problems, affecting "other" people, rather than an urgent crisis requiring immediate action.

### Conclusion

The deepest problems in this society would stem from the inherent contradictions within a system that is designed to exploit people without their knowledge. The most profound issues would include widespread psychological distress, the erosion of genuine social bonds, environmental collapse, intellectual stagnation, and systemic injustice. These issues would create a society that is fragile, unsustainable, and ultimately bound to collapse or evolve into something radically different. The greatest tragedy is that most people, within this system, would not even recognize their own subjugation—perpetuating a cycle of self-deception and resignation.

## Prompt:

How would an individual go about fixing those very deep problems?

## ChatGPT said:

Fixing the deep, systemic problems in a society where the majority of people are enslaved without realizing it would be an incredibly difficult, complex, and long-term process. However, there are strategic steps that an individual or a small group of individuals could take to begin addressing these issues. The approach would require a combination of personal transformation, collective action, and strategic disruption of the system. Here’s a breakdown of how an individual might go about fixing these deep problems:

### 1. **Self-Awareness and Personal Transformation**

**Strategy**: The first step to fixing societal problems is changing oneself. This involves awakening to the reality of one’s own situation and recognizing how deeply the system affects both individual lives and collective society.

- **Critical Reflection**: Begin by questioning everything—your values, the status quo, and the systems that govern your life. Recognize the ways in which you are complicit in, or trapped by, the system. Engage in deep self-reflection, journaling, and self-education to understand how you’ve been conditioned.
- **Unplug from the System**: Gradually begin to detach from the systems that perpetuate your subjugation, such as consumerism, social media, or other distractions. This might involve reducing your screen time, questioning your spending habits, and engaging more in real-world, meaningful activities.
- **Develop Critical Thinking**: Study philosophy, psychology, history, and political theory to gain a deeper understanding of how societies have been controlled in the past and how to organize for resistance. This helps in forming a vision of a better world.

### 2. **Building Community and Solidarity**

**Strategy**: Change on a societal scale requires collective action. The power of a single person is limited, but by connecting with others, you can begin to build a community of like-minded individuals who are committed to fighting the system.

- **Find Like-Minded People**: Seek out others who are questioning the system or who are already engaged in activism or social change. This could be through grassroots movements, political groups, or online communities focused on radical change.
- **Create Safe Spaces for Dialogue**: Organize informal gatherings where people can discuss the problems in society without fear of censorship or retaliation. These spaces can serve as incubators for new ideas and strategies.
- **Empathy and Collective Action**: Build relationships based on mutual respect and empathy. Encourage others to challenge their own beliefs and realize how the system exploits them. Use these connections to form collective actions, such as protests, campaigns, or mutual aid projects.

### 3. **Disrupting the Economic System**

**Strategy**: Economic control is at the heart of most forms of modern slavery. To fix this, individuals must work toward creating alternatives to the current economic system that empowers people rather than exploits them.

- **Financial Independence**: One way to escape the cycle of debt and economic dependency is to work toward financial independence. This could involve reducing reliance on exploitative industries, starting alternative forms of income (e.g., cooperative businesses, freelancing), or even adopting a minimalist lifestyle to reduce consumer needs.
- **Support Worker Cooperatives**: Invest your time, energy, or money into businesses that are worker-owned and democratically run. These cooperative businesses don’t just aim to profit the owners but distribute wealth more fairly among workers.
- **Advocate for Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: Support or start campaigns for policies like UBI, which would provide a living wage to every citizen, reducing the dependency on exploitative labor and allowing people more freedom to engage in creative, meaningful work.

### 4. **Challenging the Information and Media System**

**Strategy**: The media plays a crucial role in keeping people distracted and uninformed. To fix this, individuals need to become active consumers and creators of information, and disrupt the dominant narratives pushed by the ruling class.

- **Engage in Independent Media**: Seek out independent, alternative sources of news and information. Support independent journalists and media outlets that challenge the mainstream narratives controlled by corporate or governmental powers.
- **Create and Share Knowledge**: Start blogging, podcasting, or making videos that provide critical perspectives on the system. Share knowledge on how people can break free from consumerism, debt, and political manipulation. This is part of building a counter-narrative.
- **Disrupt Social Media**: Use social media platforms to spread awareness and organize, but be strategic. Social media can be a tool for activism, but it must be used to build real-world action and not just to engage in superficial debates.

### 5. **Promote Education for Liberation**

**Strategy**: Education is one of the most powerful tools for dismantling the oppressive systems that perpetuate slavery. Changing the educational system or creating alternative learning environments is essential.

- **Teach Critical Thinking**: If you’re in a position to educate others (whether as a parent, teacher, or mentor), prioritize critical thinking over rote memorization. Encourage students to question authority, analyze historical and contemporary power structures, and think creatively about solutions.
- **Build Alternative Learning Systems**: Support or create educational initiatives outside of traditional institutions, such as community schools, online education platforms, or mentorship programs that teach people how to challenge the status quo and develop practical skills for self-sufficiency.
- **Promote Collective Knowledge**: Encourage the sharing of knowledge between communities to empower people. This might include community-led education on issues such as economic justice, climate change, and political power. Knowledge should be decentralized and accessible to all.

### 6. **Engage in Direct Action and Political Activism**

**Strategy**: To create change, individuals must actively challenge the system in ways that disrupt its operations and demand reforms or revolution.

- **Protest and Civil Disobedience**: Join or organize peaceful protests, demonstrations, and acts of civil disobedience that draw attention to the injustices in the system. Use these actions to put pressure on policymakers and corporations to enact change.
- **Engage in Political Campaigns**: Support or run for political office with the goal of enacting systemic change. Advocate for policies that reduce inequality, such as universal healthcare, free education, wealth redistribution, and corporate regulation.
- **Defend Freedom of Speech and Assembly**: Advocate for the protection of democratic rights like freedom of speech and the right to protest. Fight against censorship, surveillance, and repression of activists.

### 7. **Reconstructing Social Systems and Values**

**Strategy**: To create a truly free society, the very values that underpin the existing system must be changed. This involves redefining success, community, and the meaning of freedom.

- **Redefine Success**: Challenge the notion that success is about wealth accumulation and individual achievement. Promote the idea that true success is about collective well-being, happiness, and self-actualization. This would involve shifting societal values away from competition toward cooperation, mutual aid, and social justice.
- **Foster Compassion and Empathy**: Build a culture of compassion and empathy where people recognize their interconnectedness. This would involve teaching people to care for one another and the environment, creating a society that values mutual support over individual gain.
- **Decentralize Power**: Support initiatives that decentralize power, whether that’s through local community organizing, cooperative governance, or democratic decision-making processes. The idea is to prevent any one group from holding too much control over the rest of society.

### 8. **Build a Movement for Long-Term Change**

**Strategy**: Change doesn’t happen overnight. It requires building momentum and creating an enduring movement that can outlast setbacks and resistance.

- **Start Small, Think Big**: Begin with local actions and projects, but always keep in mind the larger goal of societal transformation. Mobilize community leaders, activists, and thinkers to join the cause and amplify the impact.
- **Foster Alliances**: Build coalitions across different groups and movements—environmental, racial justice, labor rights, and political reform. The more diverse and united the movement, the stronger it will be in challenging the system.
- **Create Resilient Networks**: Build long-term, sustainable support structures, such as mutual aid networks, alternative media outlets, and political organizations, that can survive even in the face of state repression or social apathy.

### Conclusion

To address the deep problems in this hypothetical society, an individual must start by breaking free from the system’s grip on their own mind and lifestyle. From there, they can begin to connect with others, disrupt the economic and political systems, challenge the media narratives, and advocate for a new model of education and social organization. It’s a journey of personal awakening and collective action, where the goal is not only to liberate oneself but to help create a world where true freedom, justice, and equality can thrive. While the challenge is immense, history has shown that even the most entrenched systems of control can be dismantled through sustained and strategic resistance.
