You don't even need that many. Less is more.
It's easier than you think.

1.8px 0.1rem
2.2px 0.1222rem
3.3px 0.1833rem (1/10 of the baseline)
4.125px 0.22916rem (1/8 of the baseline)
4.4px 0.2rem
5.5px 0.25rem (a sixth of the baseline)
6.6px 0.3rem (a fifth of the baseline)
8.25px  0.375rem (a quarter of the baseline)
11px  0.5rem (a third of the baseline)
12px 0.6666rem
13px  0.7222rem
14px  0.7777rem
15px  0.8333rem
16.5px  0.75rem (half of the baseline)
17.6px  0.8rem
22px  1rem (two thirds of the baseline)
23px  1.0454rem
24px  1.0909rem
24.75px 1.125rem (three quarters of the baseline)
25px  1.1364rem
26px  1.1818rem
27px  1.2273rem
27.5px  1.25rem (5/6 of the baseline)
28px  1.2728rem
29px  1.3182rem
30px  1.3637rem
31px  1.4091rem
32px  1.4545rem
33px  1.5rem (the baseline)
36px  1.6363rem
41.25px 1.875rem (5/4 of the baseline)
44px  2rem (4/3 of the baseline)
49.5px 2.75rem (3/2 of the baseline)
66px  3rem (twice the baseline)



for some reason, 1rem = actually 33px, same as the baseline. I think it's because of line-height: 1.5; but I think this is only true in the context of font size.
