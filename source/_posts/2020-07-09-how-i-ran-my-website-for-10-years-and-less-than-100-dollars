## Subtitle: A no-nonsense guide to publishing a website _almost_ for free

I want to apologise right away for the clickbaity title, ...

I never had to pay a single penny.

### Hosting

Heroku is amazing, free plugins, hours etc.

### DNS

Cloudflare as the authoritative DNS is great, caching, analytics etc.

### Domain

This is literally the only thing I ever had to pay for.

### Jamstack

Consider the https://jamstack.org/, list the benefits.

### Bonus: Performance

(Add that perf image you added on stuff/ folder. But make it webp and/or optimize the png.)
