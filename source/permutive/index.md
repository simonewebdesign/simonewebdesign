## I'm a full-stack web developer.<br>I love to make things — I love the web, design, code and things that are enjoyable to use.


<br>


### Let's talk about you

You are Permutive. You're hiring talented people exclusively. You want to show the world that you're the best. You need the best people that will bring you far more customers than you have today.

#### An amazing product

You already have an awesome product, but awesome is still not enough. You want it to be *perfect*. For that, you need someone with amazing skills, someone who really loves tough challenges.

You've been backed by the best investors already, you need to keep running. You want someone who has the courage to fight for an idea, the will to innovate. Someone that's not afraid to show he's right.

#### Your great software

You have the best software around, built with the right technologies for the job: Haskell and Scala. You're very interested in functional languages, and you want to build a company culture where people love what they do with the code they write.

Your customers will be amazed.

### Let's talk about me

I've been called “restless”. I mean, I sleep at night, but thing is, there's so much to be interested in that it's literally *impossible* to get bored. So much to learn about, such as new programming languages and design patterns, and so much to pour one’s creativity into, like apps, tools, video games. There are a million things I want to try, to do, to be better at. There is never enough time in the day, week, or year for everything; though I’m really trying.

#### What I do

I work for a pretty cool company in London called MyMeds&Me. We use some rad technologies too, such as Elm and Elixir. We have an amazing team of developers, we use and admire functional programming, and we try our best to make customers happy. I'm a frontend developer here, which means I'm the one in charge of making our web products reliable, beautiful and fun to use.

I'll be honest: MyMeds&Me is a great place to work. I have creative freedom, a good work environment, talented co-workers and I'm handsomely compensated. Really, I cannot think of anything that would keep me from being here a very long time, except that I want more. Not necessarily stuff or money, but I want to learn more and get better. I want to keep the pressure up. I want to take on the toughest challenges.

I didn’t make this page lightly; I have spent some time considering whether or not to really go for this. <b>I love a challenge.</b> I love the idea of working with people that are brilliant; whom I admire and respect. I know what it means to work together to make something great. And I look forward to making Permutive better by my addition. I want to learn from you and I want to teach you and I want to learn things together.

<blockquote>I had the pleasure of having pair programming sessions with Simone, in which I could appreciate his pragmatic approach to problems and his great enthusiasm and productivity. I was impressed by his extensive knowledge of web development. I've also appreciated his friendly and genuine personality.

### Portfolio

Here's a selection of websites I designed that I’m pretty proud of. For most of them I created it from start to finish including client consultation, design, HTML/CSS/JS, backend development and copywriting.
