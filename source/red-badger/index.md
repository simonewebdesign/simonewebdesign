## I'm a polyglot developer.<br><br>I love to make things — I love the web, code and hard challenges.<br><br>I think we should talk.

### Let's talk about you

You are **Red Badger**. You're hiring talented people exclusively. You're [44th](https://red-badger.com/about-us/news/2016/09/10/tech-track-100-red-badger-ranked-44th) in Tech Track 100! You're showing the world that you're the best. You need the best people that will bring you far more customers than you have today.

#### A remarkable team

At **Red Badger** it's the [people who matter the most](https://red-badger.com/about-us/people/), and that's why you attracted some great minds in your team. **Red Badger** is what happens when a bunch of **wildly talented people** get to work together.

#### Amazing projects

You've done some [really impressive work](https://red-badger.com/our-work/), built with the right tools for the job. You want to keep producing innovative solutions, building a company culture where people love what they do. You even host the amazing [React London](https://react.london/) and [Functional Programming for the Web](http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Programming-for-the-Web/)!

### Let's talk about me

I'm passionate about building and learning new things. There's so much to learn about, such as new programming languages and design patterns, and so much to pour one’s creativity into, like apps, tools, video games. There are a million things I want to try, to do, to be better at. There is never enough time in the day, week, or year for everything; though I’m really trying.

I love open source. I'm constantly pushing something on GitHub, whether it's a [new command line tool I'm working on](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/elm-new), or a [contribution to some hugely popular library like React](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/5411).

#### What I do

I work for a pretty cool company in London called My Meds & Me. We use rad technologies too, such as **Elixir**, **Phoenix**, **Docker** and **Kubernetes**. We are a really nice bunch, we use and admire functional programming, and we try our best to make customers happy. I'm a full-stack developer here, which means I find myself always doing a bit of everything, ranging from back end to front end, even devops. Ultimately I'm in charge of making our web product reliable, beautiful and fun to use.

I'll be honest: My Meds & Me is a great place to work. I have creative freedom, a good work environment, talented co-workers and I'm handsomely compensated. Really, I cannot think of anything that would keep me from being here a very long time, except that I want more. Not necessarily stuff or money, but I want to learn more and get better. I want to keep the pressure up. I want to take on the toughest challenges.

I didn’t make this page lightly; I have spent some time considering whether or not to really go for this. <b>I love a challenge.</b> I love the idea of working with people that are brilliant; whom I admire and respect. I know what it means to work together to make something great. And I look forward to making **Red Badger** better by my addition. I want to learn from you and I want to teach you and I want to learn things together.

I was impressed by his extensive knowledge of web development. I've also appreciated his friendly and genuine personality.
